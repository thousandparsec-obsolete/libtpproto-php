This library provides the basic tools for connecting to and 
communicating with Thousand Parsec servers.

It does *NOT* support creating servers (and never will).

The library is extremly simple, it does only minor sanity checking
so be careful in what you do!

This library is under the LGPL.
For this license any PHP application which uses this library is 
considered to be "linked" against the library and thus not required
to be release under (L)GPL compatible licenses. Any changes to 
these original files (or code taken from these files) MUST follow
the LGPL.
